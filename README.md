# Fraud-Detection-Project

The Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG) is a public and a non-administrative company, it is responsible for delivering electricity and gas across Tunisia. The company suffered tremendous losses in the order of 200 million Tunisian Dinars due to fraudulent manipulations of meters by consumers.

Using the clientâ€™s billing history, the aim was to detect and recognize clients involved in fraudulent activities.

The data was wrangled to have more data that would beter reflect and capture those commiting fraud.
Weighting, oversampling, and undersampling techniques were tested on this imbalanced dataset.
A neural network classifier was finally selected optimising for false-postives and false-negatives.
